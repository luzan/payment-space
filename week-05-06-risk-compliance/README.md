# Week 5-6: Risk & Compliance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, the goal is to:

- Understand chargebacks lifecycle and representment
- Recognize common fraud patterns and prevention strategies
- Know PCI-DSS requirements and compliance levels
- Understand AML/BSA obligations for payment facilitators

## Why This Matters

This is where payment companies succeed or fail. A single merchant with uncontrolled chargebacks can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. A PCI breach can end a business. Regulatory non-compliance brings fines and loss of processing rights. Risk and compliance aren't overhead - they're survival.

## Module Structure

| File                           | Description                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| [topics.md](./topics.md)       | Detailed breakdown of research topics |
| [questions.md](./questions.md) | Self-assessment questions             |
| [resources.md](./resources.md) | Reading materials and sources         |

## Key Concepts to Master

### Chargebacks

The dispute lifecycle from initiation through representment. Understanding reason codes, timeframes, and the PayFac's liability position.

### Fraud Patterns

Card testing, friendly fraud, account takeover, triangulation fraud, and how to detect and prevent each.

### PCI-DSS

Data security standards, compliance levels, and what being a Level 1 Service Provider means architecturally.

### AML/BSA

Anti-money laundering requirements, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting obligations.

## Time Allocation Suggestion

- Week 5: Chargebacks deep dive, fraud patterns, monitoring programs
- Week 6: PCI-DSS architecture, AML/BSA requirements, compliance programs

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, designing a risk monitoring system should feel achievable. Understanding why certain thresholds matter (1% chargeback ratio), what PCI scope means for architecture, and what triggers AML reporting should be clear.
