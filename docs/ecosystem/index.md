# Payment Ecosystem Foundation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand how money flows in a card transaction
- Identify all entities involved in payment processing
- Distinguish between different payment industry roles
- Grasp the PayFac model and its unique position

## Why This Matters

Building a payment platform without understanding the ecosystem is like building a bridge without knowing what rivers are. Every architectural decision, every API design, and every compliance requirement traces back to these fundamentals.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into four major sections:

### Fundamentals

Core concepts that form the foundation of the payment industry:

- **Four-Party Model** - The foundational structure of card payments
- **Card Network Role** - How Visa, Mastercard, and other networks operate
- **Transaction Lifecycle** - From authorization to settlement
- **Debit Networks & Routing** - PIN vs signature debit processing

### Industry Players

Key entities and their roles in the payment ecosystem:

- **Payment Processors** - Front-end and back-end processing
- **Payment Gateways** - E-commerce transaction handling
- **Acquiring Banks** - Merchant risk and underwriting
- **ISOs** - Independent sales organizations
- **ISVs** - Software vendors with embedded payments

### PayFac Model

The payment facilitator approach and alternatives:

- **PayFac Overview** - Master merchant model explained
- **Implementation** - Building a PayFac platform
- **Comparing Models** - Traditional vs ISO vs PayFac
- **Alternative Payments** - ACH, wallets, BNPL, RTP

### Study Guide

Learning materials and self-assessment:

- **Topics** - Research areas and focus points
- **Questions** - Self-assessment exercises
- **Resources** - Reading materials and references

## Key Concepts to Master

### The Four-Party Model

The foundation of card payments - understanding cardholder, merchant, issuing bank, and acquiring bank relationships.

### Card Networks

How Visa, Mastercard, and other networks serve as rule-makers and routing infrastructure.

### Industry Players

Distinguishing between payment processors, gateways, acquirers, ISOs, ISVs, and payment facilitators.

### The PayFac Model

Understanding why a payment facilitator is a "master merchant" and what that means for liability and operations.

## Time Allocation Suggestion

- **Week 1:** Four-party model, card networks, money flow
- **Week 2:** Industry players, PayFac model, ISO/ISV dynamics

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, explaining the complete journey of a credit card transaction from tap to merchant settlement should feel natural. The distinctions between processors, gateways, and acquirers should be clear.

## Progress Tracking

Track your progress through the module using the study guide questions. Each major topic includes self-assessment exercises to validate understanding.
