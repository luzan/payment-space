## Questions (To Be Developed)

### Underwriting Fundamentals

1. What is the primary objective of merchant underwriting?
2. How does merchant underwriting differ from credit underwriting (lending)?
3. What is the difference between straight-through processing (STP) and manual review?
4. When should enhanced due diligence (EDD) be triggered?

### Risk Factors

5. Name three high-impact risk factors that would likely result in application decline.
6. What is the MATCH list and how long does a merchant remain on it?
7. Why is "card not present" (CNP) considered higher risk than "card present" (CP)?
8. What combination of factors would indicate a medium-risk merchant?

### MCC Codes

9. What does MCC stand for and who assigns these codes?
10. How many digits are in an MCC code?
11. Name three high-risk MCC categories.
12. What is MCC misclassification and why is it a problem?
13. Why might a merchant need separate merchant accounts for multiple business lines?

### Risk Scoring

14. What are the three main approaches to risk scoring?
15. What is the tradeoff between rules-based scoring and machine learning models?
16. What decision would you make for a risk score of 75 (assuming 80+ is auto-approve)?
17. What is model drift and why does it matter?

### Scenario-Based Questions

18. **Scenario:** A merchant applies with these attributes:
    - MCC: 5999 (Miscellaneous Retail)
    - Credit Score: 680
    - Time in Business: 8 months
    - No MATCH hit
    - Online rating: 3.5 stars

    Using the scoring framework in the Risk Scoring section, calculate their risk score and recommended decision.

19. **Scenario:** An established business (5 years) applies with excellent credit (750), positive reviews (4.5 stars), no MATCH hit, but wants MCC 7995 (Gambling). What factors would you consider in your underwriting decision?

20. **Scenario:** A merchant provides MCC 5999 (Miscellaneous Retail) but their website sells CBD products. What should you do?

21. **Scenario:** You receive an application from a brand-new business (formed 2 weeks ago) projecting $500k/month in volume with an average ticket of $2,000. Credit score is 720, no MATCH hit. What red flags exist and what would you request?
