## Overview

Risk factors are characteristics of a merchant's business, processing history, and ownership that indicate the likelihood of fraud, chargebacks, or regulatory violations. Effective underwriting evaluates multiple risk dimensions.

## Risk Weighting

Not all factors carry equal weight:

**High Impact Factors:**
- MATCH list hit
- Prohibited business type
- Sanctions screening match
- Significant fraud history

**Medium Impact Factors:**
- High-risk MCC
- Poor credit score
- New business with high projected volume
- Negative online reviews

**Low Impact Factors:**
- Website design quality
- Exact ticket size
- Minor variations in business name

## Risk Factor Combinations

Risk is often about combinations:

- **High Risk:** New business + high-risk MCC + poor credit + no web presence
- **Medium Risk:** Established business + medium-risk MCC + good credit + some negative reviews
- **Low Risk:** Established business + low-risk MCC + strong credit + positive reviews + processing history
