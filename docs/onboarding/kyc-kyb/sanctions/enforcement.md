> **Last Updated:** 2025-12-28
> **Status:** Complete

Understanding recent enforcement helps calibrate your compliance program.

## Major Cases

| Case | Penalty | Year | Violation Summary |
|------|---------|------|------------------|
| **GVA Capital Ltd.** | $215.99M | 2025 | Managing U.S. investments for sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg |
| **EFG International AG** | $3.74M | 2024 | Processing transactions for clients in multiple sanctions programs |
| **Payward (Kraken)** | $24M+ | 2022 | Crypto exchange facilitated transactions from sanctioned regions (Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria) |

## 2024 OFAC Enforcement Statistics

**Total Enforcement Actions:** 12 actions in 2024

**Total Penalties:** $48.8M (civil penalties)

**Industry Breakdown:**
- Financial Services: ~90% of total penalties
- Other industries: ~10%

## Key Trends (2024-2025)

### 1. Continued Focus on Financial Institutions

Banks and payment processors remain primary enforcement targets. Regulators expect sophisticated compliance programs.

### 2. Increasing Crypto Enforcement

Cryptocurrency platforms face heightened scrutiny. OFAC expects same compliance standards as traditional finance.

### 3. Emphasis on Compliance Program Effectiveness

Penalties correlate with:
- Whether company had compliance program
- Effectiveness of program
- Response to violations
- Voluntary self-disclosure

### 4. Strict Liability Consistently Applied

No intent required for liability. "We didn't know" is not a defense.

## Lessons from Enforcement Actions

### 1. Geographic Screening Failures

**Issue:** Many violations involve failure to screen transaction geography (IP addresses, customer locations).

**Lesson:** Implement IP geolocation screening for all transactions, not just merchant onboarding.

### 2. Insufficient Ongoing Monitoring

**Issue:** One-time onboarding screening is not enough. Ongoing monitoring gaps lead to violations.

**Lesson:** Screen merchant base against SDN updates at least daily. Don't rely on vendor assumptions.

### 3. Vendor Reliance Risks

**Issue:** Assuming third-party vendors are screening properly without verification.

**Lesson:**
- Verify vendor screening frequency in writing
- Conduct periodic testing of vendor capabilities
- Maintain oversight of vendor performance

### 4. Compliance Program Weaknesses

**Common Deficiencies:**
- Lack of written policies
- Insufficient training
- No independent audits
- Poor documentation

**Lesson:** Invest in comprehensive compliance program before it's tested by regulators.

### 5. Voluntary Self-Disclosure Benefits

**Pattern:** Cases involving voluntary self-disclosure and remediation received significantly reduced penalties.

**Lesson:** If you discover a violation, consider voluntary disclosure to OFAC. Consult legal counsel immediately.

## Penalty Calculation Factors

OFAC considers these factors when determining penalties:

### Aggravating Factors (Higher Penalties)

- Willful or reckless conduct
- Actual knowledge of violation
- Attempts to conceal
- Pattern of violations
- Harm to sanctions program objectives
- No compliance program

### Mitigating Factors (Lower Penalties)

- Voluntary self-disclosure
- Substantial cooperation
- Remedial response
- Effective compliance program
- Isolated occurrence
- No actual knowledge

## Compliance Program Elements That Matter

Based on enforcement actions, OFAC values:

1. **Management Commitment**
   - Senior leadership involvement
   - Adequate resources allocated
   - Compliance officer authority

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Regular, documented assessments
   - Customer/geographic risk evaluation
   - Product/service risk analysis

3. **Internal Controls**
   - Screening at multiple points
   - Escalation procedures
   - Blocking mechanisms

4. **Testing & Auditing**
   - Independent testing
   - Periodic audits
   - Remediation tracking

5. **Training**
   - Regular, documented training
   - Role-appropriate content
   - Testing of knowledge
