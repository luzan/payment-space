## MCC Codes

19. **What is an MCC code, and who assigns it?**

20. **Why would a merchant want to be classified under a different MCC than their actual business? Why is this problematic?**

## Scenario Questions

### Scenario 1: High-Risk Application

**Question 23:** A new merchant applies. The business is 2 months old, sells dietary supplements online, ships internationally, and the owner has a personal bankruptcy from 3 years ago. Walk through the underwriting considerations.

**Topics to Address:**
- Time in business risk

- Delivery timeframe and international shipping risk
- Credit history concerns
- Appropriate decision (approve with restrictions, decline, enhanced due diligence)

**Topics to Address:**
- Volume variance from projections
- Chargeback ratio thresholds (exceeds 1.8% excessive threshold)
- Re-underwriting triggers
- Enhanced due diligence requirements
- Potential MATCH reporting
- Reserve adjustments

**Topics to Address:**
- Low-risk criteria (established business, low-risk MCC, good credit, small volume)
- Medium-risk criteria (conditional approval factors)
- High-risk criteria (manual review required)
- Prohibited criteria (auto-decline)
- Score thresholds
