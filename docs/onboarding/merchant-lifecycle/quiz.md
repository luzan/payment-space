### Scenario-Based Questions

15. **Scenario:** A merchant processes $100,000/month with a 10% rolling reserve and 180-day hold period. What is their approximate reserve balance after 6 months of steady processing?

16. **Scenario:** A merchant's chargeback ratio climbs from 0.3% to 1.2% over two months. What actions should you take?

17. **Scenario:** You discover a merchant has changed their business model from selling electronics to selling CBD products without notifying you. What is your response?

18. **Scenario:** A merchant you terminated for excessive chargebacks (ratio 2.1%) requests you not report them to MATCH because they've resolved the issue. How do you respond?

19. **Scenario:** During routine monitoring, you notice a merchant's average ticket increased from $50 (at underwriting) to $450 (current). Their volume also tripled. What steps do you take?

20. **Scenario:** A merchant notifies you of a change in ownership - Alice, who owned 60%, sold her stake to Bob and Carol (30% each). What re-verification is required?
