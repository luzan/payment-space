# Week 3-4: Merchant Onboarding & Underwriting

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, the goal is to:

- Understand the complete merchant onboarding workflow
- Know KYC/KYB requirements and why each data point matters
- Grasp underwriting principles and risk assessment
- Understand MCC codes and risk categorization

## Why This Matters

Merchant onboarding is where regulatory compliance meets user experience. Every field collected, every verification performed, and every decision made has legal, financial, and operational implications. Getting this wrong means either regulatory violations or accepting too much risk.

## Key Concepts to Master

### KYC (Know Your Customer)

Identity verification for individuals - why it's required and how it's performed.

### KYB (Know Your Business)

Business verification - legal entity validation, beneficial ownership, business legitimacy.

### Underwriting

The art and science of risk assessment - deciding who to onboard and at what terms.

### MCC Codes

Merchant Category Codes and their impact on risk assessment, interchange rates, and monitoring.

## Time Allocation Suggestion

- Week 3: KYC/KYB requirements, data collection, verification methods
- Week 4: Underwriting principles, risk scoring, MCC codes, decision automation

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, designing a merchant onboarding flow should feel intuitive. Understanding why each piece of information is collected (regulatory requirement vs. risk assessment) and how underwriting decisions are made should be clear.
