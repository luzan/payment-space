# Week 11-12: Regulatory & Partnership Realities

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, the goal is to:

- Understand sponsor bank relationships and requirements
- Know card network registration obligations
- Understand state money transmitter licensing requirements
- Navigate the regulatory landscape for payment facilitators

## Why This Matters

Technical excellence means nothing without the legal right to operate. A payment facilitator cannot exist without a sponsor bank, cannot process without card network registration, and may need licenses in dozens of states. These partnerships and regulatory requirements define what's possible to build.

## Key Concepts to Master

### Sponsor Banks

What sponsor banks provide, what they require, and how to structure these critical partnerships.

### Card Network Registration

Visa and Mastercard requirements for payment facilitators, including financial requirements and ongoing obligations.

### Money Transmitter Licensing

State-level licensing requirements, capital requirements, and the complexity of multi-state compliance.

### Alternative Models

PayFac-as-a-Service and other options for companies not ready for full PayFac registration.

## Time Allocation Suggestion

- Week 11: Sponsor banks, card network registration, financial requirements
- Week 12: State licensing, alternative models, go-to-market considerations

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, understanding the regulatory pathway to becoming a payment facilitator should be clear. Knowing what partnerships are required, what capital is needed, and what alternatives exist for different stages of growth should be understood.
