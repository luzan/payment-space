# Week 1-2: Payment Ecosystem Foundation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, the goal is to:

- Understand how money flows in a card transaction
- Identify all entities involved in payment processing
- Distinguish between different payment industry roles
- Grasp the PayFac model and its unique position

## Why This Matters

Building a payment platform without understanding the ecosystem is like building a bridge without knowing what rivers are. Every architectural decision, every API design, and every compliance requirement traces back to these fundamentals.

## Key Concepts to Master

### The Four-Party Model

The foundation of card payments - understanding cardholder, merchant, issuing bank, and acquiring bank relationships.

### Card Networks

How Visa, Mastercard, and other networks serve as rule-makers and routing infrastructure.

### Industry Players

Distinguishing between payment processors, gateways, acquirers, ISOs, ISVs, and payment facilitators.

### The PayFac Model

Understanding why a payment facilitator is a "master merchant" and what that means for liability and operations.

## Time Allocation Suggestion

- Week 1: Four-party model, card networks, money flow
- Week 2: Industry players, PayFac model, ISO/ISV dynamics

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, explaining the complete journey of a credit card transaction from tap to merchant settlement should feel natural. The distinctions between processors, gateways, and acquirers should be clear.
